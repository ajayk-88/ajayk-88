# HRMS & Automation Suite

This repository contains a collection of three integrated Python-based projects:

1. **HRMS (Human Resource Management System)** ‚Äì A Django web application for managing employee data, attendance (including shift-based and GPS-based), and leave tracking.
2. **Selenium Automation + SMTP Mailing** ‚Äì A Python automation script for browser-based tasks (like data scraping or form submissions) and email notifications using SMTP.
3. **Invoice Detection using YOLOv5** ‚Äì A deep learning model implementation to detect invoice fields and extract structured data from invoice images.
